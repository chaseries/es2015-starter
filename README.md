# Es2015 Starter

## How to use it

**Note**: This assumes you have Node and npm installed. If not, do that first!

Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/chaseries/es2015-starter`), then `cd` into it and run the following commands:

```
$ npm i
$ ./run.sh
```

Navigate to `localhost:8080` and voil√†! You're all set up. 

## Dear newer users:

The development server is serving `index.html` from `/build/`. Don't modify `main.js` in this folder at all! (Your changes will be overwritten.) Instead write to `src/main.js`. When this becomes unwieldy, do yourself a favor and look at MDN's introduction to the es2015 module system.
